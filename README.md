## Hi! My name is Waqas. 

Having double Masters in Computer Science and Engineering (with specialization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning); 2 years of experience as Data Scientist (AI Researcher); 40+ Coursera Certifications in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, Automation, and related technologies; 50+ portfolio Projects in Exploratory Data Analysis, Interactive Visualization, Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Recommendation), Deep Learning (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing), and related technologies: I am able to say that I am Data Enthusiast and love working with Data.

My first hands on interaction with Data Science was in 2015, when I had to develop Machine Learning based Resource Estimation technique during my Bachelor’s final year project. Since then I made a decision to work in this industry for rest of my life. For that reason, I did double masters with focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I mostly learnt by watching any video and tearing through any book I could find on anything remotely related to data (disruptive technologies). I was insatiable.

I believe that not only my drive and skillset make me the right candidate for data related roles but my personality traits can also help me stand out. I'm exceptional at analysis and critical assessment; I'm a fast learner and adaptable. In this era of internet and enormous knowledge availability, these traits can provide me the fuel to go long way and learn, relearn, and unlearn at the required pace.
